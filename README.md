# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Level two of this homework was completed with the help from a question and answer posted to Stack Overflow. The question was submitted by Julia Sweet.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945103/resetting-filters-before-adding-new-ones

I've also included my intial attempt at level two as a separate .js file.  Please note I've only included this code for visibility of my work and the index.html document does not reference this file.
